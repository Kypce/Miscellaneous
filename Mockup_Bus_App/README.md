# Mockup Bus App

This project fully details a project proposal for a bus tracking app containing information such as use cases, scope, software architectures, and UI/UX design.

### Overall Description
- This document outlines an improvement on the current UM bus tracking web application (https://www.umshuttles.com/map) by turning into a more user-friendly mobile app.
- The current application is clunky and slow, especially when used on mobile to track the buses' location on the go.

### Use-Cases
- Use-cases is a concept that outlines interactions between actors and the system to achieve a certain goal/outcome.
- This document outlines mutliple use-cases and actors and also includes diagrams showcasing them.

### Software Architectures
- Software architectures are designs related to the system's structure and behavior.
- The document outlines conceptual, cloud-based, and database architectures valid for this application.

### UI/UX
- The document also features a custom-made UI/UX design made with Norman's principles of design in mind.
- The UI was made with a rough mockup and prototyped using Figma.
